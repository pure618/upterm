Consider enabling untracked cache and split index if supported (see git update-index --untracked-cache and git update-index --split-index), Otherwise you can use no to have git status return more quickly without showing untracked files.

When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content). Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior before 1.7.0).
